# SOTS2ModelLoader
Converts Sword of the Stars 2 Models and Textures to OBJ files

After at least a couple of years of trying to decypher the binary format of SOTS2 .scene~ files, I've at least got basic geometry and texture information which can be output to OBJ files and viewed in blender.

If you're any good with 3D model formats and think you can add to the data field descriptions, please submit a pull request or contact me!
